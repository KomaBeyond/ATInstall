# ATInstall
this is an auto install shell script for automatic install the LAMP, LN(T)MP in linux system. create by Koma.

u can use it to install LAMP, LNMP or LT(Tengine)MP env.
also u can chose one of them to install, for example, if u chose to install LAMP but u dont't want to install all of them
so the script supply u chose intall the Http or Mysql or PHP or Nginx or Tengine only.
but as u know, if u install the PHP only, u have to install the Web Server first.

for someday, the script also will help u to install the extension for nginx/tengine or php.
that's my wish, it's not complete already.
